## Title

Architect's View on Frameworks versus Reference Implementations

## Topic

The role of the Software Architect is to align a company on the best practices for building software at a company. Most Architects are not coding in their day-to-day. When Waterfall development was prevalent, this often meant creating UML documents and high-level architecture design docs and requirements.

Today, the primary tools for aligning how fast-moving teams create applications are internal frameworks or reference implementations. We will explore what works and what doesn't work.
