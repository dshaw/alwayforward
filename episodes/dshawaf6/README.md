## Title
Always Forward with dshaw: Dev Related on Modules

## Topic

Modules have given us the ability to reuse code and most developers use them every day. How much do we know and understand about the current modules system we use and the changes that need to be made?  Currently, we have two ways of handling modules: the CommonJS modules system (CJM) and the ECMAScript Module system (ESM). When using Node and when programming for the web we have been using CJM for years but the shift to ESM is happening. 

In this podcast, we'll discuss the history of how we got to these non-compatible systems, the steps the Node Modules Working Group is taking, what you can do and why this is great news for devs from front to back. We may even talk about Michael Jackson Script, because, why not. Come join us and bring your questions :)
