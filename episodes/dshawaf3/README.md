## Title

Always Forward with dshaw: Architect's View on Backend for Frontends (BFFs)

## Topic

Are we still BFFs? The [Backend for Frontends](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) model helped paved the way way for mass Node.js adoption and has defined much of full-stack development for the past few years. Now that divergent, monolithic platforms have been replaced by full-stack API backed services powered by Node.js, teams are finding the BFF model too limiting. We'll explore alternative approaches? Does the BFF still have a place in our architectural toolkit? Is GraphQL the best answer?
